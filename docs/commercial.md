# Commercial smart TV's and mediaboxes

Commercial devices relevant to this project fall apart in commercial smart TV's and mediaboxes.

## Smart TV's
Modern smart TV's meet all the *functional* requirements of this project. They can play both DVBC-C cable TV (requiring a so-called CI+ module from the TV service provider) and TV services on the internet (the latter usually at lower resolution to stimulate the use of the service provider's prime offering).

## Mediaboxes in The Netherlands
All major Dutch TV service providers offer interactive TV through leased mediaboxes that meet all the *functional* requirements of this project. With these boxes they gain the insight in end user viewing behavior rather than the smart TV manufacturer.

The table below lists the major Dutch TV service providers that provide twisted pair copper, coax or glass fiber network access with internet and TV:
