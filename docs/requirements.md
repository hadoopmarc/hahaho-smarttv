# Requirements for the smart TV project

## Must-have features

* playing live TV shows, broadcast via either the internet or
the cable network
* playing video streaming services like Netflix and Youtube from the
internet
* remote operation options like a remote control, smartphone app or a
wireless keyboard + touchpad
* personal video recorder (PVR)

## Nice-to-have features

* Electronic Program Guide (EPG) for Dutch and West-European TV shows
* playing media from a USB storage device

## Non-functional requirements

* acceptable booting time (aim for 30 seconds)
* acceptable active power usage (aim for 10 W excluding screen)
* acceptable standby power usage (aim for 0.5 W excluding screen)
* open source with long term support, at least supported by a
thriving community
* high quality video (resolution and reliability), so video over a LAN connection (no Wi-Fi, Miracast, etc.)
* meets legal requirements, in particular regarding the use of protected content and the interplay with providers of streaming services. To be clear, lots of documentation on tinkering with smart TV's addresses the use of VPN connections to defeat discovery of illegal use of protected content. However, [gaining root access to a smart TV](hacking.md#Rooting) is [not an illegal act by itself](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS_jailbreaking#Legality).
