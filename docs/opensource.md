A bewildering number of [software projects exist](https://www.smarthomebeginner.com/best-plex-alternatives-2022/
) that cover part or all of the project's requirements. And [here](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/raspberry-pi-smart-tv-projects/) is more. A similar number of [smart-TV platforms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_smart_TV_platforms) exist that  mostly run on proprietary hardware and can run some of these software projects or 3rd party apps. However, when we require:

* open source software
* open hardware (like the Rasbian Pi or Pine64)
* a large ecosystem of users and developers

[two projects](https://www.smarthomebeginner.com/plex-vs-emby-kodi-jellyfin-2020/) stand out:


* [kodi](https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc)
* [jellyfin](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin)

Also of interest is [LineageOS](https://lineageos.org/), which provides Android firmware for various supported devices. Open hardware devices for streaming video are not (yet) supported, but an unofficial port for AndroidTV on the Raspberry Pi is available from [https://konstakang.com/tag/LineageOS/](https://konstakang.com/tag/LineageOS/).
