A bewildering number of [software projects exist](https://www.smarthomebeginner.com/best-plex-alternatives-2022/
) that cover part or all of the project's requirements. And [here](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/raspberry-pi-smart-tv-projects/) is more. A similar number of [smart-TV platforms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_smart_TV_platforms) exist that  mostly run on proprietary hardware and can run some of these software projects or 3rd party apps. However, when we require:

* open source software
* open hardware (like the Rasbian Pi or Pine64)
* a large ecosystem of users and developers

[two projects](https://www.smarthomebeginner.com/plex-vs-emby-kodi-jellyfin-2020/) stand out:


* [kodi](https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc)
* [jellyfin](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin)
