Investigate options for a maker's smart-TV and document the selected design

## Introduction
Introduced around 2015, smart TV's have become the dominant form of
television sets in 2023. Although smart TV's may have enriched the
watching experience of their users compared to traditional TV sets
in some ways, there are two main objections against smart TV's:

1. Smart TV's are basically an [advertizing platform](https://adguard.com/en/blog/smart-tv-ad-blocking.html). The manufacturers smart TV's
force (additional) advertizements on the user. In addition, the
manufacturers do not respect the user's privacy and monitor their
viewing habits to enable targeted advertizements.

2. Smart TV's are remotely managed by the manafacturer, forcing firmware
and software updates that may act against the user's interests. In particular, smart TV's are closed systems that do not comply with [the maker's manifesto](https://raumschiff.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/0071821139-Maker-Movement-Manifesto-Sample-Chapter.pdf) that   
envisions applying technology as part of a making process that is
'fundamental to what it means to be human'.

In this git repository, the author and (hopefully) collaborators investigate what options exist to own a smart TV that does not suffer
from the objections listed above. The investigation is carried out
under the umbrella of the [HaHaHo Makers Lab Utrecht](https://www.meetup.com/hahaho-sharingtechnology-innovative-tech-meetings/events/290854372/). Some of the repo content is necessarily aimed at the
access to Dutch television service providers.
